# ESP32-CAM_cat_feeder_project
This project is a DIY smart cat feeder built around the ESP32-CAM (AI-Thinker module). The feeder detects motion using a PIR sensor, wakes from deep sleep to save power, and captures photos with the onboard camera. Images and status updates are sent via Telegram Bot API, allowing remote interaction through simple chat commands.
